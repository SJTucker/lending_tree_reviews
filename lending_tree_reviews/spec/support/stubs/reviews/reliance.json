I was always connected with a representative who had immediate access to my file and answered promptly and politely. My first contact was with Max Ortiz and he made the application simple. From then on he always promptly answered Emails or calls and if he was not available whomever answered the call gave me undivided attention. It reminded me of 'the old days' when customers were important to a business. Thank you all!",
